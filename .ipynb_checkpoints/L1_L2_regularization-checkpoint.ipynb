    "# Overfitting (aka variance):\n",
    "- A model is said to be overfit if it is over trained on the data such that, it even learns the noise from it. An overfit model learns each and every example so perfectly that it misclassifies an unseen/new example. For a model that’s overfit, we have a perfect/close to perfect training set score while a poor test/validation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reasons behind overfitting:\n",
    " 1. Using a complex model for a simple problem which picks up the noise from the data. Example: Fitting a neural network to     the Iris dataset.\n",
    " 2. Small datasets, as the training set may not be a right representation of the universe.\n"
